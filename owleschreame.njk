<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Founded in Cambridge in 2008 by <strong>Artistic Director Brice Stratford</strong>, Owle Schreame was created to explore the realities of
  <em>oral storytelling</em> and <em>Medieval &amp; Renaissance English theatre practice</em>.
  Over time the company evolved the techniques it rediscovered—incorporating experimental and radical approaches to illuminate the oldest forms of drama.
  The resulting style is unique, and they have been honing it ever since.
