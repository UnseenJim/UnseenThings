<h1>New Forest Clown Lab</h1>

<p><strong>Starting in November 2025</strong>, I’ll be leading a fortnightly Clown workshop in Brockenhurst, New Forest, open to both beginners and professionals. These are drop-in classes rooted in the traditions of Lecoq and Gaulier.  It can be exhilirating, it can be stupid, it can be frightening, but regardless of your background and experience it will be fun and useful.</p>

<p><strong>It’s pay-what-you-can</strong> (suggested donation £10), held every two weeks at the Brockenhurst Community Hub  — a five-minute walk from the station, with easy trains from Bournemouth and Southampton, and plenty of parking.</p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p>Whether you’re brand new to this style or a world famous superstar clown, these workshops are a place to hone your instincts, refine your timing, and find what works on stage.</p>

<p>We’ll explore games and exercises, some all together, some in smaller groups or solo. We'll be moving around a lot so wear clothes you can move in. Red noses are sometimes required, sometimes not - I'll provide some, but feel free to bring your own.</p>

<h2>Who's Leading It?</h2>

<p>The sessions are led by me, James Carney, a Lecoq-trained performer and theatre-maker with years of experience in clown, mask, and physical theatre.</p>

<h2>Location</h2>
